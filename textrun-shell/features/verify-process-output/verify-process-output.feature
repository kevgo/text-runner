  Scenario: verifying the output of a console command
    Given the source code contains a file "create-server.md" with content:
      """
      Create a file <a type="workspace/new-file">**server.js** with content:

      ```
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('one');
        console.log('two');
        console.log('three');
        setTimeout(() => {}, 1000)
      }, 100)
      ```
      </a>
      """
    And the source code contains a file "verify-output.md" with content:
      """
      Start the server by running <code type="shell/server">node server.js</code>.
      You see <a type="shell/server-output">
