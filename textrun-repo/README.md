# Text-Runner Actions for verifying the content of the current repository

This package provides [Text-Runner](https://github.com/kevgo/text-runner)
actions for verifying documentation containing the content of source code files
from the repository.

- [installation](#installation)
- [repo/existing-file-content](#repoexisting-file-content)
- [repo/executable](#repoexecutable)

### installation

To use these actions, add this package as a development dependency by running
<code type="npm/install">npm i -D textrun-repo</code> or
<code type="npm/install">yarn i -D textrun-repo</code>.

### repo/existing-file

Sometimes you want to mention the name of a file from your application's source
code in the documentation. The
<b type="action/name-full">source/existing-file</b> action verifies this. As an
example, consider a codebase contains a file
<a type="workspace/new-file">**config.yml** with content `foo: bar`</a>. The
documentation for this codebase might want to mention this configuration file:

<a type="extension/runnable-region">

```markdown
The file <b type="repo/existing-file">config.yml</b> defines configuration
values.
```

</a>

The filename of the source code file is relative to the Markdown file describing
it.

### repo/existing-file-content

Sometimes you want to just display a file from your application's source code in
the documentation. The
<b type="action/name-full">source/existing-file-content</b> action verifies such
documentation. As an example, consider a codebase contains a file
<a type="workspace/new-file">**config.yml** with content `foo: bar`</a>. The
documentation for this codebase might want to mention this configuration file:

<a type="extension/runnable-region">

````markdown
<a type="repo/existing-file-content">

The **config.yml** file defines configuration values. The current settings are:

```
foo: bar
```

</a>
````

</a>

This action assumes that the documentation contains the filename in bold or
italic and the content as a single or triple fenced code block. The filename of
the source code file is relative to the Markdown file describing it. You can
also provide a directory in which your file is located via a link in the active
region. <a type="workspace/new-file"> Let's say you have a file
**foo/bar/hello.txt** in your code base with the content `hello world!`. </a>
You can display its content in your documentation via this active region:

<a type="extension/runnable-region">

```markdown
<a type="repo/existing-file-content">

The **hello.txt** file in the [bar folder](foo/bar) contains this section:

`hello world!`

</a>
```

</a>

### repo/executable

The <b type="action/name-full">repo/executable</b> action verifies that an
executable that the documentation mentions exists and is indeed executable. It
doesn't run the executable. As an example, consider a codebase that contains an
executable <b type="new-executable">scripts/setup</b>. The semantic
documentation for this codebase might look like this:

<a type="extension/runnable-region">

```html
Run the <b type="repo/executable">scripts/setup</b> binary to set up your
environment.
```

</a>
