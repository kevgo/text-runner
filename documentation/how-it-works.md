# How TextRunner works

To make a part of any Markdown file actionable by TextRunner,
wrap it in an HTML tag with the attribute `textrun="[action name]"`.
If you need an HTML tag that doesn't change the layout of your text,
that's the `<a>` tag.
As an example,
let's say a tutorial tells its reader to create a file `config.yml`
with the content `foo: bar` on their machine.
The markdown code of this tutorial might look something like this:

```markdown
## Creating a configuration file

Please create a file with the name _config.yml_ and the content:
` 窶義` foo: bar `窶義`
```

To make this part of the documentation executable,
surround it with an `<a>` tag that specifies that we want to create a file:

<a textrun="run-markdown-in-textrun">

```markdown
## Creating a configuration file

<a textrun="create-file">
Please create a file with the name _config.yml_ and the content:
`窶義`
foo: bar
`窶義`
</a>
```

</a>

TextRunner calls parts of text documents that are marked up like this _active blocks_.
The attribute `textrun="createFile"` tells TextRunner to run the `createFile` activity type here,
which creates a file in TextRunner's working directory.
The built-in implementation of the `createFile` activity type
takes the name of the file to create
from a bold or italic section inside the `<a>` tag,
and the content to write into the file from a code block.
Text outside of `<a>` tags is ignored by TextRunner.

If you run `text-run` on the command line to test this document,
TextRunner creates a file <a textrun="verify-workspace-file-content">_config.yml_
with the content `foo: bar`</a> in the `tmp` subfolder of your current directory.
