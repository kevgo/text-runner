# Example: calling global tools

This example codebase contains a global tool aptly named `tool`. This file is
the documentation for this tool. We want to give usage examples like this one:

> You run the tool with a number as an argument. Here is an example:
>
> <pre textrun="shell/exec">
> tool 123
> </pre>
